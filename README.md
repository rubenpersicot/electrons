# electrons

Electrons is an academic project. It is programming assignment of the course "Evolution problems" taught at the [Ecole des Ponts Paristech](https://www.ecoledesponts.fr/) by Frédéric Legoll and Virginie Galland Ehrlacher.


This course aims at introducing students to the mathematical and numerical study of partial differential equations modeling the evolution across time of a quantity of interest. Evolution problems are presents in a myriad of domains, both in the industry of within academic research, in  physics, chemistry, biology, finance ect


## Objective
The goals of this programming assignment are:
1. To compute the strip diagram of a semiconductor material.
2. To compute the diffusion coefficients of electrons within the conduction band.

The movement of electrons within a semiconductor material can be described as an eigen-value problem. The mathematical aspect of this problem is studied in the first part of the code. The second part of it is dedicated to the implementation of the [Finite Difference Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method) (FEM).
## Installation

To check our project, you will need [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html).

## Usage 
Simply run the jupyter notebook !

## Final grade
